Hi, my name is Jacob and I'm a geoscientist and 3rd year PhD student at the Drexel University. My research focuses on structural analysis of volcanoes 
and the assessment of associated hazards. For my studies I use a combination of fieldwork, remote sensing, and modeling using QGIS + ArcGIS, Python and ENVI. 
In the future, I would like to learn how to integrate my Python skills into GIS and how to create 3D models using photogrammetry/SfM techniques to round 
off my portfolio.

In my repositories you can find the data I work with. Also don't forget to have a look at my website >insert link here<!
