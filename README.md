Hi, my name is Jacob, and I'm a geoscientist and 4th year PhD student at the Drexel University. My research focuses on structural analysis of volcanoes 
and the assessment of volcanic hazards, such as lava and landslides. For my studies I use a combination of fieldwork, remote sensing, and modeling using QGIS + ArcGIS, Python and ENVI. 
In the future, I would like to learn how to integrate my Python skills into GIS, and how to create 3D models using photogrammetry/SfM/LiDAR techniques to round 
off my portfolio.

In my repositories you can find the data I work with. Also, don't forget to have a look at my website https://braunerj.github.io
